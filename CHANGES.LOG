***** v. 1.0.1

is resolving the issue of 

2006.07.20 	need fast exact test for HWE, along the lines of fastcc, 
		as HWE.exact is too slow (Yurii)

and

2006.10.11	gwaa.data should be easily sub-settable -- now one 
		needs to extract @gtdata and subset and @phdata and 
		subset and then merge (also using base R things) (Yurii)


***** v 1.0.2

Function scan.glm is introduced; this allows to scan for interactions in 
an easy way. This is essentially a modified scan.gwaa. 

New function to convert ped-files type of data to internal format, 
convert.snp.ped, was arranged

Function add.plot.scan.gwaa was added

Library "methods" loaded on start-up

***** v 1.1.2

scan.glm patched (it did not work with df=2 when a SNP had only 2 genotypes)

minor fix in sub-setting of snp.data class

ccfast, qtscore, scan.glm, emp.ccfast, emp.qtscore and plot.scan.gwaa are modified.
Major change concerns ccfast and qtscore: now, 1-df and 2-df tests are 
computed simultaneously within the C functions. 
The class "scan.gwaa" now contains both 1- and 2-df P-values. 
This also addresses the point on TODO:

2006.08.17	implement qtscore function with 2df

Small fix in qtscore and ccfast (to act on 1 d.f. when # genotypic classes is 2)

The function scan.gwaa removed as redundant

qtscore now allows for analysis using strata (Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel)

Added average/median chi2 to the "scan.gwaa" class (to be used for genomic
control)

TODO fixed:
2006.10.11	q-value returned by qvaluebh95() is wrong

emp.qtscore and emp.qtfast optimised (runs 3-10 times faster) by
removing unnecessary checks and calling C function directly 
(instead of calling ccfast/qtscore)

NAMESPACE introduced

Update of documentation: now R CMD check passes all checks

Formal class introduced for scan.gwaa-class

demo(srdta): demo(srdtawin) is made by removing load-data from demo(srdta)
because this may not work when there are no administrator's priviliges

***** v 1.1.3

scan.glm.2D and scan.haplo.2D functions added

run.haplo.score.slide renamed to scan.haplo for consistency

heteroz() added

scan.gwaa-class is modified: effects are also returned. 
This led to modification of C code for fastcc, qtscore, R
code for qtscore(), ccfast(), fcc(), emp.qtscore(), emp.ccfast(), 
scan.glm()

improved memory management in functions ccfats(), emp.ccfast(), 
qtscore(), emp.qtscore(), summary()

show.ncbi() added

v 1.1-4 

Due to accumulated changes, version number updated.

Multiple improvements and fixes + catable() function

v 1.1-6

Improved memory managmenet. In particular, @chromosome slot is now 
stored as a factor. Extensive changes may have led to some (not yet 
discoevered) bugs...
