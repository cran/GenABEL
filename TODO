2006.08.05	Arrange fast "glm"-like for use in gwaa.scan
		(low)

2006.08.17	implement a function to read WTCCC type of data
		(directly from R or at least indirectly through a
		companion parogram)
		(high)

2006.10.11	optimisation of emp.ccfast and emp.qtscore 
		As most of the time in C is spent on extracting data 
		from 2-bit format, most efficient would be to pass list 
		of permuted indexes to the C procedure.

2006.10.11	check.marker test for redundancy: also limit by region 
		(low)

2006.11.06	Arrange formal class for check.marker-class, scan.gwaa-class
		and scan.gwaa.2D-class

2007.02.14	Implement Fisher Product Method for multiple traits and 
		multiple SNPs

2007.02.14	When the map is not cumulative, would be good to store 
		the "delta"s for every chromosome and somehow let user
		choose which values (GW or chromosome-specific) to
		use and report.

2007.02.23	Arrange a function to study time-till-event

2007.02.23	Permutations (adaptive) for qtscore nominal significance

2007.03.16	Add "corrected" statistics to the P-P plot from estlambda,
		may be it is good idea if it will also return "corrected" 
		Ps (chi2s)

2007.11.04	QC: checks for autosomal SNPs which predict sex

2007.12.21	Add Pc2df to scan.gwaa output

2007.12.21	Cahnge "quality" in convert.snp.mach to r2
